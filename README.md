# submod_dioxus
Rust web GUI for modifying .srt subtitle files.

This project is adapted from the Rust CLI app [submod_rs](https://github.com/davidde/submod_rs) as a way to get exposed to Rust GUI development.  
As the name indicates, it uses the [Dioxus GUI toolkit](https://dioxuslabs.com/).

To run the app locally, run:
```
trunk serve
```
